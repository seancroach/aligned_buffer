# `aligned_buffer_internals`

This crate is the "body" of the `aligned_buffer` crate, but must exist seperately to prevent cyclical dependencies with `aligned_buffer_macro`.

For the main crate, please view the documentation for `aligned_buffer`
[here](https://github.com/seancroach/aligned_buffer/tree/main/aligned_buffer).
