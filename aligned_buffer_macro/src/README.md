# `aligned_buffer_macro`

The attribute macro designed for the `aligned_buffer` crate. Due to how
procedural macros work, it's impossible to implement this macro from the
`aligned_buffer` crate.

For the main crate, please view the documentation for `aligned_buffer`
[here](https://github.com/seancroach/aligned_buffer/tree/main/aligned_buffer).
